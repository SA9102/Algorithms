# Algorithms
This repository contains a list of various algorithms implemented by myself using Python.

Where possible, they make use of data structures which are also implemented by myself (in the DataStructures.py file).

I acknowledge that it's best to use data structures from standard libraries for large-scale projects. But in the case of implementing some algorithms, I thought it would be a nice exercise and challenge to implement my own data structures and use them.

## Update Log:

- 17/01/23
Added an algorithm that performs a depth-first search on a weighted, undirected graph implemented using an adjacency list (depth-first search.py)

- 14/01/23
Repository created and first algorithm added (bracket sequence validator.py).
